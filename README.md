Text generation with Markov chains
# 🔠 Task 03 - Text Generation using Markov Chains

This repository contains my implementation of **Task 03** for the **Generative AI Internship** at **Prodigy Infotech**. The goal was to implement a simple statistical model using **Markov Chains** to generate text from a given word.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Implement a basic text generation algorithm using **Markov Chains**. The model predicts the next word in a sentence based on the current word, using probabilities learned from a training dataset.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python (Standard Libraries)
- `random` module
- Command Line / Google Colab / IDE

---

## 💡 Steps Performed

1. Trained the model on a sample paragraph
2. Stored word-to-word transitions in a dictionary
3. Generated a new sentence starting from a given prompt
4. Used random choice to simulate probability-based prediction

---

## 📌 Sample Prompt & Output

**Training Text:**
> "Artificial intelligence is transforming the world. AI is everywhere, from voice assistants to autonomous cars. The future of technology is AI-driven innovation."

**Prompt:**  
`"Artificial"`

**Generated Text:**  
> "Artificial intelligence is everywhere, from voice assistants to autonomous cars..."
